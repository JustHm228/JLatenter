## Warning

I, of course, don't think that there could be vulnerabilities in such a project, but it's better to be prepared in advance than to prepare in a hurry later.
Actually, this warning itself is intended to inform you that if you have opened this file, then you are most likely paranoid and you need to get a good night's sleep.
**Stay healthy! ❤**

## Supported Versions

Currently there's no a stable version you can use without bugs but the most stable now is... 0.1-build.1 due to it's the only version you can use now.
Yeah, that's very few... but it's more than nothing so wait until I publish a new version.

| Version     | Supported          |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.build.1 | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability (if you somehow find it in such a small project, of course) you just need to create a new issue under the template "Vulnerability report" and describe what is it and how to reproduce it.
It's very simple.

P.S. Let me remind you that if you opened this file, then most likely you have paranoia and problems sleeping. Please get some sleep! **Stay healthly! ❤**
